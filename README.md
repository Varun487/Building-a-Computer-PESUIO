# Building-a-computer-PESUIO

PESUIO is a peer-to-peer learning platform by PES University, where students get to design and teach a course in college. I taught the course 'Building a Computer from first principles', based on the NandToTetris course in coursea. I taught for approximately 12 hours over the span of 3 weeks.
